Hello! Thank you for browsing The Archive. I am Clayton Ward, the developer of this site. I have years of software development experience and decided to create this site as a place to display all of my projects.

This site was developed with Angular using TypeScript, HTML and CSS. The back-end is a RESTful API I built, running Express and MongoDB. Feel free to explore the API with the link towards the top right of this page. The front-end of this site is stored on one of my GoDaddy Apache servers, which I also use for my freelance work and company Flare Software LC. The [backend](https://github.com/theclayton/the-archive-backend) is running on a Google Cloud Platform Debian Linux instance running a reverse proxy with nginx (mostly for TLS encryption) and a NodeJS insatnce monitored with PM2. MongoDB is used to store all archive data. File uploads are stored on the server and served with the same express server process as the API for simplicity and speed.

I published this site for the very first time on October 8, 2020. Feel free to browse my projects, by scrolling through the list of All Projects. Or by searching for projects or technologies and languages used. Also don't miss the featured projects on the home page.
